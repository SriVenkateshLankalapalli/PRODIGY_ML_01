Project: House Price Predictions using Linear Regression.
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
This project aims to build a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on key features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. This model will help in estimating house prices for given input features, providing a valuable tool for real estate analysis and decision-making.

Introduction
House prices are influenced by various factors, including the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. By implementing a linear regression model, we aim to understand the relationship between these features and the price, and to predict future house prices based on these features.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about house prices, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The dataset is sourced from a real estate database or can be created using synthetic data for demonstration purposes.

Data Preprocessing
Loading the Data: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Cleaning the Data: Handle missing values and outliers.
Feature Engineering: Create additional features if necessary and normalize/standardize the data for better model performance.
Splitting the Data: Split the data into training and testing sets.
Model Implementation
Linear Regression Model: Use the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library to build the model.
Training the Model: Train the model using the training dataset.
Prediction: Make predictions on the test dataset.
Evaluation
Metrics: Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Visualization: Plot the actual vs. predicted prices to visualize the model's performance.
Results
Summarize the model's performance and present the evaluation metrics. Discuss any observations and potential improvements.

Conclusion
Conclude the findings from the project, including the effectiveness of the linear regression model in predicting house prices and any recommendations for future work.
